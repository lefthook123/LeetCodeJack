205. Isomorphic Strings


Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.



public class Solution {
    public bool IsIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        //if(s.Length!=t.Length)return false;
        Dictionary<char,char> dict = new Dictionary<char,char>();
        HashSet<char> ht = new HashSet<char>();
        
        for(int i=0;i<s.Length;i++){
            if(!dict.ContainsKey(s[i])){
                if(!ht.Add(t[i]))return false;
                dict[s[i]]=t[i];
            }
            else{
                if(dict[s[i]]!=t[i])return false;
            }
        }return true;
    }
}
