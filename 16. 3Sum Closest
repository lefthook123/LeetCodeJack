16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).



public class Solution {
    public int ThreeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Array.Sort(nums);
        int mindiff = Int32.MaxValue;
        int value = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.Length-2;i++){
            int left = i+1;
            int right = nums.Length-1;
            while(left<right){
                int sum = nums[left]+nums[right]+nums[i];
                int diff = Math.Abs(sum-target);
                if(diff<mindiff){
                    mindiff=diff;value=sum;
                }
                if(sum<target){
                    left++;
                }else if(sum==target)return sum;
                else{
                    right--;
                }
            }
        }
        return value;
        
    }
