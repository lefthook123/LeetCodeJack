189. Rotate Array


Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.


public class Solution {
    public void Rotate(int[] nums, int k) {      
        int len = nums.Length;
        k%=len;
        reverse(0,len-1,nums);
        reverse(0,k-1,nums);
        reverse(k,len-1,nums);  
    }
    public void reverse(int s,int e,int[] nums){
        int left = s;
        int right = e;
        while(left<right){
            int temp = nums[left];
            nums[left++]=nums[right];
            nums[right--]=temp;
        }
    }
}
