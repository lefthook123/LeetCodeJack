274. H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.



public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        Array.Sort(citations);
        int len = citations.Length;
        if(len==0)return 0;
        //i: h-index
        if(citations[0]>=len)return len;
        for(int i=len-1;i>0;i--){
            if(citations[len-i-1]<=i&&citations[len-i]>=i)return i;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}



//O(n)
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.Length;
        if(len==0)return 0;
        int[] count = new int[len+1];
        
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            if(citations[i]>len){
                count[len]++;
            }else{
                count[citations[i]]++;
            }
        }
        
        int t=0;
        for(int i=len;i>=0;i--){
            t=t+count[i];
            if(t>=i)return i;
        }
        return 0;
        
    }
